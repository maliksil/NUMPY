## NUMPY

#### What is NumPy

NumPy is a powerful Python library primarily used for numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

#### Key Features of NumPy:
High-performance multidimensional arrays: NumPy's core data structure is the ndarray, which is optimized for numerical operations.

Broadcasting: Enables operations between arrays of different shapes.

Mathematical functions: Offers a rich set of functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, and more.

Integration with other libraries: Seamlessly works with other scientific Python libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

#### Why Use NumPy?

Speed: NumPy operations are significantly faster than using Python's built-in lists for numerical computations.

Efficiency: It provides concise and expressive syntax for manipulating arrays.

Versatility: Its applications span various fields, including data science, machine learning, image processing, and scientific computing.

#### Example 

import numpy as np

#### Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

#### Perform operations
print(arr * 2)  # Multiply each element by 2
print(np.mean(arr))  # Calculate the mean
print(np.sum(arr))  # Calculate the sum


#### NumPy Functions: A Deeper Dive
NumPy is packed with functions designed to efficiently operate on numerical data stored in arrays. Let's explore some key categories and examples:

 ##### Array Creation Functions
np.array():  Converts Python sequences into NumPy arrays.
Python

import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
Use code with caution.

np.arange(): Creates an array with evenly spaced values within a given range.

Python
b = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # Start, stop, step
Use code with caution.

np.linspace(): Creates an array with evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.

Python
c = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  # Start, stop, number of points
Use code with caution.

np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.empty(): Create arrays filled with zeros, ones, or uninitialized values.
Python
d = np.zeros((3, 3))
e = np.ones(5)
f = np.empty(2)
Use code with caution.

Array Manipulation Functions
np.reshape(): Reshapes an array without changing its data.
Python
g = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
Use code with caution.

np.transpose(): Transposes an array.

Python
h = np.transpose(g)
Use code with caution.

np.concatenate(), np.vstack(), np.hstack(): Combine arrays.

Python
i = np.concatenate([a, a])
j = np.vstack([g, g])
k = np.hstack([a, a])
